    "At the start of our project, each of our three data files had been partially cleaned by for example removing columns that were considered irrelevant to our analysis.\\\n",

    "The data fields highlighted most prominently in the metadata file are:\n",
    "1. Appointment Status\n",
    "2. Healthcare Professional Type\n",
    "3. Mode of Appointment\n",
    "4. Time between Booking and Appointment\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we consider what the metadata tells us about each of these four data fields. This is important because it will help us focus our initial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (1) Appointment Status (appointment_status)\n",
    "The Appointment Status for each appointment changes over time moving from (1) 'Available' to (2) 'Booked' to (3) 'Attended' or 'Did Not Attend' or 'Cancelled'.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:purple\">Question:\n",
    "Do cancelled appointments revert to 'available'?</span>\n",

    "##### Two data issues are noted in the metadata file\n",
    "1. For between 3% and 6% of appointments the final status of the appointment remains 'Booked'. The status of these appointments in our dataset is reported as 'Unknown'.\n",
    "2. Due to an issue with data collection, missed appointments are under-reported for the period from July 2018 until and including November 2018 (five months). ***Note:*** *We will use our analysis to evaluate the impact of this issue on the reliability of the missed appointments statistics.*\n",

    "<span style=\"color:purple\">Insight: If the appointments that continue showing as 'Booked' after the appointment time has lapsed are more likely to be in fact missed appointments, the missed appointments statistic will be understated. For example, if out of 100 appointments five are known to have been missed and three are shown as unknown, but in fact we know they have also been missed, the true rate of missed appointments would be 8% instead of the reported 5.2% (1 - 92/97).</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (2) Healthcare Professional (hcp_type)\n",
    "The healthcare professional type data point for each appointment is based on what's recorded as the occupation of the NHS employee attending the appointment. Due to data extraction issues our data shows only the value 'GP' and 'Other Practice Staff'. We are told in the metadata that a small proportion of GP appointments (for example some of the appointments with Trainee GPs or GP Partners) may be misclassified as appointments with other practice staff.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### (3) Mode of Appointment (appointment_mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:purple\">Insights: \n",
    "- <span style=\"color:purple\">The data on the mode of appointments (for example face-to-face, telephone, online, or home visits) is important because it could show us differences in the likelihood of appointments being missed depending on their mode. Knowing about such differences can inform decisions about reducing the rate of missed appointments.\n",

    "### 2.3. What could the rest of the data fields tell us?\n",
    "In this section, to further set the context for our data analysis, we consider what the metadata file tells us for the following data fields which are the the subject of the objectives for activity #2:\n",
    "1. Service settings\n",
    "2. Context types\n",
    "3. National categories\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1) Service settings\n",

    "In my interpretation aided by Google searches for the terms ['GMS/PMS/APMS contracts'](https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/gp-practices/funding-and-contracts/gms-contract-and-pms-agreement-differences); ['Additional Roles Reimursement Scheme'](https://www.england.nhs.uk/gp/expanding-our-workforce/); and ['Extended Access Provision'](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/extended-access-general-practice/), a description of the four service settings could be:\n",
    "- **General Practice**: appointments delivering GP services in core contractual hours.\n",
    "- **Extended Access Provision**: appointments delivering GP services outside of core contractual hours, either in the early morning, evening or at weekends.\n",
    "- **Primary Care Network**: appointments delivering services by healthcare professionals other than GPs (for example 'clinical pharmacists', 'first contact physiotherapists', and 'health and wellbeing coaches')\n",
    "- **Other**: appointments delivering services at the GP surgery, but by other service providers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) Context types\n",
    "'Context type' here refers to whether the appointment is an encounter with a patient or an activity which is part of patient care, but without the presence of the patient. I imagine an example of an activity which is part of patient care, but does not involve the presence of the patient might be the analysis of test results.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The metadata suggest two 'Context types' plus an option to record the appointment as 'Unmapped' which would be used in case of an error in receiving the data or the data not captured.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The two 'Context types' are:\n",
    "- 'Care Related Encounter'\n",
    "- 'Inconsistent Mapping'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Care Related Encounter' seems self-explanatory - an appointment attended by a patient and a healthcare provider.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "'Inconsistent Mapping' as explained by the metadata file refers to a recorded appointment that did not involve the attendance of a patient. The use of the term 'inconsistent' shows that the notion of a patient appointment is contradictory with the notion that the patient is not in attendance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (3) National categories\n",
    "From the metadata this seems to relate to the reason why the patient needed the appointment. It includes 13 options, for example 'General Consultation Acute', 'General Consultation Routine', and 'Planned Clinical Procedure'.\n",
